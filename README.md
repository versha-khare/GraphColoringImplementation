# GraphColoringImplementation
### Graph coloring Algorithm Implemented -
* 1. Backtracking
* 2. Greedy BFS 
* 3. Greedy DFS
* 4. Welsh powell

## input graph - Mycielski graph
 
 *  input text file in inputFile package(it has all vertices and edges)

## Steps to run Algorithm
  * import project in Eclipse
  * MainStart.java has all implementation
  * Need to select Algorithm in MainStart.java class
  * Output have all edges with their respective colors
  * It will also return execution time of that Algo.

## Steps to solve Sudoku puzzle solver using backtracking Algorithm
   * input - Sudoku.txt file
   * Run SudokuPuzzleSolver.java to get output.
